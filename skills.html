    <h1>Skills and Abilities</h1>
    <p>
      Problem Solving - My experience at ELIS gave me daily opportunities to apply my training to find effective short and long term solutions.
      <br><br>
      Critical thinking - SEN children require you to think rationally and thoughtfully to determine the best steps needed.
      <br><br>
      Communication - Coaching 5 year olds has taught me to communicate clearly and concisely to convey effective information.
      <br><br>
      Leadership - Although I was a successful head coach and business owner my biggest personal achievement was becoming the elected 1:1 TA representative for a 50 member staff team leading sessions on how to effectively work as 1:1 TA.
      <br><br>
      Teamwork - The importance of an effective team environment has been central to my ideology and my success. The key to my success has been my ability to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the team environment and lend my strengths and balance my weaknesses against another persons strengths and achieving the best outcome.
      <br><br>
      Emotional Intelligence - My ability to identify and manage one’s own emotions as well as the emotions of others were perfected working with SEN children which conditions such as ADHD, ODD and ASD. I have developed strong skills to be rational, even-keeled, whilst handling extremely volatile emotions without losing control.
      <br><br>
      Responsibility - Being accountable for my duties and owning up to mistakes is part of being responsible. Whilst it yielded results and success, admitting to myself that my command approach needed to compromise partly to a guided discovery approach has been one of my biggest personal battles in being responsible.
      <br><br>
      Languages - A native English speaker, my parents spoke Krio at home, I learned French at school (A2) and I’ve been teaching myself Japanese (A2).
      <br><br>
      Organisation - Building a successful business, my structural and man-management skills, as well as each my approach to each task and project were through a mixture of charismatic leadership and organising effective  bureaucratic frameworks to get the best results.
